# 00. Promo Video Script (Improved for Narration)

## Intro

Hello, everyone!  
In this video, we’re going to build a fully-functional e-commerce website, just like Amazon, complete with an admin dashboard. We’ll use Next.js, MongoDB, and free AI tools to make it happen.

## Cart Page

## Checkout Page

Clicking **“Proceed to Checkout”** takes us to the **sign-in page**, unless the user is already logged in.

You can log in using your email and password or sign in with Google. Let’s create a new account.

After entering your information, you’ll be redirected to the checkout page.

The checkout process has three steps:

1. Add your **address** and select "Ship to this address."
2. Choose a **payment method**, such as PayPal, Stripe, or Cash on Delivery. Let’s go with PayPal.
3. Review your order, adjust quantities if needed, and select a shipping speed. Finally, place the order.

## Checkout Payment Page

Once the order is placed, you’ll be redirected to PayPal to complete your payment. After confirming, you’ll return to the website to see the order details and receive a receipt via email.

## Order Details Page

On the **order details page**, you can check the order status and see the items purchased.

To access this page, click on the account menu, select **Your Orders**, and choose the order you want to view.

From the account menu, you can also update your profile. For example, under **Login & Security**, you can edit your name and save changes. The updated name will reflect across the site.

### Mobile Friendly

This e-commerce website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly. Let’s switch to the mobile view and create a new order. As you can see, all pages and elements are accessible and functional on mobile devices.

### Admin Dashboard

Let’s log out as a customer and log in as an admin. Then, select "Admin" from the header menu to open the admin dashboard.  
On this page, we have stat boxes displaying total revenue, sales, customers, and products. You can adjust the report range to, for example, two months ago. The sales overview chart will update to reflect the new date range.

Scroll down to view the "Earnings Report" for the last six months. On the left card, we have the "Product Performance Report," which shows the top-selling products within the selected date range.  
At the bottom of the page, you’ll find the "Best-Selling Categories" as a pie chart and a list of recent sales.
